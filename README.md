# Interest_Rate_Prediction
This Project is based on Prediction of Interest Rates of Loans Loan Data. 

## Data
Download the Data from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data
The pre-processed dataset is  added in the 'Data' folder with two separate files -  one having the original data and the other having the test data (both were added after initial pre-processing.

## Code
Steps:
The idea was to predict the Interest Rate using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm and visualize necessary findings using Tableau
The 'Code' folder has the following 5 sub-folders. The task of files under each sub-folder has been mentioned below.

1.Understanding the Data: This notebook to is to understand the data more accurately and minutely.

2.Cleansing, Preprocessing and EDA: As the name suggests, the notebooks in this folders to cleanse and pre-process data followed by the notebook to which is used to impute the missing Values using MICE and another notebook to normalize the data.

3.Feature Selection: This folder has 2 notebooks -  one to implement feature tools and other to select features using LassoCV

4.Models: This Folder contains Sub-Folders with notebooks to implement Linear Regression, Random Forests, Neural Networks and also implement AutoML using AutoSKLearm, H20.ai and Tpot

5. Testing: This notebook is used to test the accuracy of the predicts.

## Evaluation Metrics
This doc file shows the outcome of the various ML Models we implemented in the project

## Visualization
After we had trained and tested the data, we visualized our finding in Tableau. The details of the same are available in this folder. This helps us understand the pattern and trends in our data as well as get insights for better decision making.
